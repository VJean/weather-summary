# weather-summary :partly_sunny:

Send a summary of the weather conditions over the next 24 hours.

To get your own notification, you'll need :
* a [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev) api key (free)
* a [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) account (also free) with an User Key and an Application Key
* (optional) a crontab on a server somewhere, to get notifications on a daily basis without thinking about it

Create yourself a `config.ini` file based on the provided `example.ini`, and you're good to go !
